# CoreAppDevsoc
 
 ## About:
 This app is designed according to the requirements of the core project assignment given by DevSoc, BITS Goa.
 Through this app, the fruits of my app development journey in my first year has been presented. 
 
 ## Learning experiences:
 Through this app I have learnt the use of HTTP package and calling of APIs. 
 I have implemented various widgets such as navbar, scrollview, listview, flexible and expandable widgets and so on.
 I have learned superficially, concept of statemanagement methods. 
 I have learned integration of Firebase authentication using google sign in API.
 And much more...
 
 ## Scope for improvement
 There are a few shortcomings in my app. For example, the items in the cart screen can be duplicated. In the coming days, I aim to improve the app to try and make it industrial standard code. I hope to achieve this level soon!
